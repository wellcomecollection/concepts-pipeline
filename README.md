# concepts-pipeline

_Some sort of ETL pipeline for concepts in the Wellcome Collection catalogue_

Running data through this pipeline results in an index to serve the concepts API with concept data, harvested from an external authority (Initially Library of Congress, then MeSH, and Wikidata, with the possibility of adding other sources as we see fit).

See https://github.com/wellcomecollection/docs/tree/main/rfcs/052-concepts-pipeline for more information.
